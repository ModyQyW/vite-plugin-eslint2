# Why?

## Reason

This project is forked from [gxmari007/vite-plugin-eslint](https://github.com/gxmari007/vite-plugin-eslint) because there were many issues and PRs waiting to be resolved, and no one was maintaining it. I sent an email to the author, but I didn't receive any response.

I forked and added some features to meet my own needs, including support for ESLint v8, `eslintPath` option, `lintInWorker` option, `lintOnStart` option, `lintDirtyOnly` option, force virtual module to be ignored, etc. when I was in 2023, the project name was `@modyqyw/vite-plugin-eslint`.

I renamed this project to `vite-plugin-eslint2` in early 2023, so you can find and use it more easily.

There are also [@nabla/vite-plugin-eslint](https://github.com/nabla) and [vite-plugin-checker](https://github.com/fi3ework/vite-plugin-checker) that provide similar functionality, please choose one to use according to your needs.
